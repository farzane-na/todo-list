# Todo List

This mini-project is a Todo List with which we can plan and write our tasks in it and check the status of it being done or not.

## Description

At the beginning of this page, we have an entry called Add Item, where we can write the desired task.
At the bottom, there are two buttons titled Add Todo List and Clear Todo List. The first button adds the item to the list and the second button deletes the entire contents of the list.
When the tasks are added, it can be seen that next to them there are two other buttons titled Complete and Delete, which are responsible for showing the status of the task and deleting them, respectively.
Note that these items are stored in the Local Storage of the user's browser and are not lost when the page is loaded.
